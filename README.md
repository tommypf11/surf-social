- Track user presence and display avatar chips

### For Site Visitors

- **Open Chat**: Click the chat button in the bottom-right
- **Send Messages**: Type in the input field and press Enter or click Send
- **Switch Channels**: Click the tabs (Web Chat, Friend Chat, Support)
- **View History**: Scroll up in the chat to see older messages
- **Load More**: Click "Load More" to see additional message history

### For Administrators

## Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.4 or higher
- **MySQL**: 5.6 or higher
- **Browser**: Modern browser with WebSocket support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Database

The plugin creates one database table:

- `wp_surf_social_messages` - Stores chat message history

This table is automatically created on plugin activation and removed on uninstallation.

## API Endpoints

The plugin exposes the following REST API endpoints:

- `GET /wp-json/surf-social/v1/chat/messages` - Retrieve chat messages
- `POST /wp-json/surf-social/v1/chat/messages` - Send a new message

## Customization

### Colors

User colors are automatically assigned based on user ID. You can customize the color palette by modifying the `colors` array in `assets/js/surf-social.js`:

```javascript
const colors = [
    '#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4', '#45B7D1', '#FFA07A', '#98D8C8',
    '#F7DC6F', '#BB8FCE', '#85C1E2', '#F8B739', '#52B788'
];
```

### Styling

The plugin uses CSS variables for easy customization. Edit `assets/css/surf-social.css`:

```css
:root {
    --surf-primary: #2C3E50;
    --surf-secondary: #34495E;
    --surf-accent: #3498DB;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Not Appearing

1. Check that the plugin is enabled in **Settings > Surf Social**
2. Verify your real-time transport is configured (Pusher or WebSocket)
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure you're not logged in as an admin with the plugin disabled

### Cursors Not Showing

1. Verify real-time connection is working (check browser console)
2. Make sure multiple users are on the same page
3. Check if WebSocket or Pusher is properly configured
4. Try refreshing the page

### Messages Not Sending

1. Check REST API is enabled (WordPress 4.4+)
2. Verify nonce is valid (try logging out and back in)
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Ensure database table was created properly

### WebSocket Connection Failed

1. Verify the WebSocket server is running
2. Check firewall allows the WebSocket port
3. For production, use `wss://` (secure WebSocket) with SSL
4. Check server logs for connection errors

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on page load times
- **Efficient**: Throttled cursor updates (50ms intervals)
- **Scalable**: Works with Pusher's infrastructure or your own WebSocket server
- **Optimized**: Automatic cleanup of disconnected users

## Security

- All user input is sanitized
- REST API uses WordPress nonces
- SQL queries use prepared statements
- No sensitive data exposed to frontend
- CORS handled by WordPress
